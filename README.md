# Botnet GUI Application

This repository contains a C++ Botnet application developed as an academic project for a Computer Networks course. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate botnet operations in a controlled environment.

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Designed as a final project for a Computer Networks course, this application simulates a botnet environment with separate server and client components, providing insight into distributed systems and network communication.

### Build the Project

From the project root directory, compile the project by running:

```
make
```

Start the server component with the following command:

```
./<server_name> <port>
```

Launch a client instance using:

```
./client <ip> <port>
